Its vibrant façade, spiritual aura, and ancient legends draw millions of devotees and travelers each year.

          <p>Mana Village, located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, is famously known as the “last village of India” near the Indo-Tibetan border. Just 3 km from Badrinath, this serene hamlet sits at an altitude of about 3,200 meters, surrounded by snow-clad Himalayan peaks, crystal-clear rivers, and lush greenery. Steeped in history and mythology, Mana is believed to be the place where the Pandavas took their final journey to heaven through the Swargarohini path. The village is also home to the legendary Vyas Gufa and Ganesh Gufa, where sage Ved Vyas is said to have composed the Mahabharata. Walking through its cobbled streets, wooden houses, and friendly locals in traditional attire feels like stepping into a timeless world. With its spiritual charm, breathtaking landscapes, and cultural richness, Mana is not just the last village of India—it’s a journey into the heart of nature and heritage.</p>
