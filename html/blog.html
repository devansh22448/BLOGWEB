        <p>
          Mana Village, located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, is
          famously known as the "last village of India" near the Indo-Tibetan
          border. Just 3 km from Badrinath, this serene hamlet sits at an
          altitude of about 3,200 meters, surrounded by snow-clad Himalayan
          peaks, crystal-clear rivers, and lush greenery. Steeped in history and
          mythology, Mana is believed to be the place where the Pandavas took
          their final journey to heaven through the Swargarohini path. The
          village is also home to the legendary Vyas Gufa and Ganesh Gufa, where
          sage Ved Vyas is said to have composed the Mahabharata. Walking
          through its cobbled streets, wooden houses, and friendly locals in
          traditional attire feels like stepping into a timeless world. With its
          spiritual charm, breathtaking landscapes, and cultural richness, Mana
          is not just the last village of India—it's a journey into the heart of
          nature and heritage.
